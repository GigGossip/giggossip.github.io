<strong>Centralized platforms have taken control of the shared economy</strong>. We have become their puppets, and they, our masters. The shared economy is locked down, with innovation allowed only when it benefits the power of these platforms.

" content="

Centralized platforms like Uber, UpWork, and DoorDash have created walled gardens where users and service providers are subject to their rules and profit-driven motives. These platforms act as gatekeepers, controlling access, setting prices, and determining the terms of service. This model stifles competition, innovation, and fairness, leaving gig workers with limited autonomy and customers with fewer choices and higher costs.

" %}


{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="h2" header="

<strong>We are on a mission to reclaim the shared economy for the people</strong>, liberating it from the grasp of centralized platforms. In doing so, we enable the shared economy to blossom with new ideas and unveil its boundless potential.

" content="

We envision a world where the shared economy is decentralized, transparent, and driven by the needs and desires of its participants rather than by the profit motives of intermediaries. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span>, the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span>, and <span class=nostr>Nostr</span>, we aim to create an ecosystem where innovation flourishes, trust is restored, and economic opportunities are accessible to all.

" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="h2" header="

<strong>Building a decentralized system tailored to the shared economy</strong> is feasible when constructed on top of <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> and aligned with its principles. Satoshi restored control of money to the people. Similarly, we are demonstrating how the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> and <span class=nostr>Nostr</span> can help us reclaim the shared economy.

" content="
The foundational principles of <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> — decentralization, transparency, and permissionless innovation—are the pillars on which we build our decentralized gig economy. By integrating <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> for payments, the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> for fast and low-cost transactions, and <span class=nostr>Nostr</span> for secure and censorship-resistant communication, we are creating a robust and resilient ecosystem that empowers users and service providers alike.

# How does it work?

### BEFORE


{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html header="
There is no communication or direct price negotiation between the customer and the service provider; everything goes through a central system, optimized for its own benefit. Traditional FIAT payment systems are used for monetary transactions.
" content="
In the current centralized model, gig economy platforms act as intermediaries, controlling every aspect of the interaction between customers and service providers. This includes setting prices, managing communications, handling payments, and resolving disputes. These platforms take significant commissions, reducing the earnings of gig workers and increasing costs for customers. Additionally, the lack of direct communication and negotiation limits the ability of both parties to reach mutually beneficial agreements.
" %}

### AFTER

{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html header="
Communication and price negotiation between the customer and the service provider take place in a free market, naturally regulated by supply and demand. <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> and the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> are used for secure payments. Screening and dispute resolution are managed by Security Centers—organizations that control final payment settlements.
" content="
In our decentralized model, customers and service providers interact directly, negotiating prices and terms without the interference of intermediaries. Payments are made using <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> and the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span>, ensuring fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. Security Centers, independent entities chosen by the network participants, handle screening and dispute resolution, ensuring fairness and accountability. This model not only reduces costs but also increases transparency, trust, and satisfaction for both parties.

# Problems with centralized shared economy platforms:
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/gen/home/night_sky.png" >


<ol>
{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="li" header="
<strong>Misaligned incentives</strong>: Centralized platforms are designed to maximize profits for the company and its shareholders, sometimes at the expense of the workers and customers. This can lead to exploitative practices, such as unfair revenue sharing, arbitrary changes to policies, and prioritizing company interests over the well-being of participants.
" content="
This misalignment of incentives is evident in practices such as surge pricing, where prices are increased during periods of high demand, benefiting the platform at the expense of both customers and workers. Similarly, changes in policies or terms of service can be implemented unilaterally by the platform, often disadvantaging workers without any recourse.

<br/><br/>
<strong>Uber stats:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Revenue Distribution from Fares</strong>:
    75% of the fare fees are paid to drivers; Uber retains 25% for software maintenance and other services.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Driver Suggestion for Improvement</strong>:
    55% of Uber drivers believe increasing pay is the biggest way to improve their experience.
  </li>
</ol>
" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="li" header="
<strong>Lack of transparency and trust</strong>: Centralized platforms often operate in an opaque manner, where the inner workings, algorithms, and decision-making processes are hidden from gig workers and customers. This lack of transparency breeds mistrust and suspicion about the fairness and integrity of the system.
" content="
For example, gig workers on platforms like Uber and DoorDash often find themselves at the mercy of algorithms that determine their pay, work assignments, and even deactivation from the platform. These algorithms are proprietary and opaque, leaving workers in the dark about how decisions are made and fostering a sense of helplessness and frustration.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Uber stats:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Driver Satisfaction Level</strong>:
    Only 8% of Uber drivers are satisfied with their working experience at Uber.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Driver Suggestion for Improvement</strong>:
    55% of Uber drivers believe increasing pay is the biggest way to improve their experience.
  </li>
</ol>
" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="li" header="
<strong>Power imbalances and lack of worker autonomy</strong>: Gig workers on centralized platforms often have little say or influence over the policies and decisions that directly impact their livelihoods. They are subject to the whims and unilateral actions of the platform operators, including potential punishments or deactivations without due process.
" content="
Workers on platforms like UpWork or TaskRabbit may find their accounts suspended or deactivated without clear reasons or an opportunity to appeal. This lack of autonomy and due process creates an environment of uncertainty and insecurity for gig workers.

<br/><br/>
<strong>Uber stats:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Driver Sentiment Towards Employment Status</strong>:
    71% of rideshare drivers prefer to remain independent rather than become Uber employees.

    Only 8% of Uber drivers are satisfied with their working experience at Uber.
  </li>
</ol>
" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="li" header="
<strong>Limited innovation and competition</strong>: The dominance of a few large centralized platforms can stifle innovation and limit the emergence of new business models and competitors in the gig economy space. This lack of competition can lead to stagnation and suboptimal outcomes for workers and customers.
" content="
The market dominance of companies like Uber and Airbnb has created significant barriers to entry for new competitors, limiting the diversity of services and innovation in the gig economy. This concentration of power restricts opportunities for gig workers and customers to explore alternative and potentially more beneficial arrangements.
" %}

{% include framework/shortcodes/more.html tag="li" header="
<strong>Privacy and data control concerns</strong>: Centralized platforms accumulate vast amounts of sensitive data about workers and customers, which can be used for surveillance, manipulation, or sold to third parties without adequate consent or control by the individuals involved.
" content="
Global internet platforms have faced numerous controversies over their handling of user data, including incidents of data breaches, unauthorized data sharing, and exploitation of personal information for targeted advertising. These practices erode trust and raise significant concerns about privacy and data security.

2. **Can your idea be used only with the <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> network?**<br/>
   It is not possible to use a classical, fiat money-based monetary system while removing the central organization and making a protocol for a globally decentralized gig economy. Fiat money is centralized by central banks. <span class=btc>Bitcoin's</span> decentralized nature aligns perfectly with our vision of a decentralized gig economy, providing a stable and secure monetary foundation.

3. **What is <span class=nostr>Nostr</span>?**<br/>
  <span class=nostr>Nostr</span> is a decentralized protocol for broadcasting and receiving messages. It is designed to be used with <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> and the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> for payments, providing a censorship-resistant and secure communication platform. In <span class=nostr>Nostr</span>, each user operates a node that relays messages, ensuring that data is decentralized and resistant to censorship. This ensures that communications are secure, private, and free from interference, enhancing trust and collaboration within the gig economy.

4. **Can <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> form a mobile mesh?**<br/>
   <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> can run on mobile devices that form a mobile mesh, but network nodes willing to broadcast messages are welcome to be implemented as heavy machines. Moreover, payment settlers are meant to be services that provide network security; therefore, they are usually implemented by companies as cloud-based services exposing their API. There is no direct need to run any operation-critical services in the cloud or any other centralized computing environment; you just need your mobile phone.

5. **How am I gratified if I only keep running a <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> app on my mobile phone?**<br/>
   Your mobile phone running a <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> node can earn money each time the route involving your node results in a successful gig payment. You will earn a part of the network reward, which you can negotiate with other nodes on a free market. All you need to do is keep it running. This passive income model incentivizes users to participate in the network, ensuring its growth and sustainability.

6. **The protocol is broadcasting a lot of messages. How can the network handle this kind of volume?**<br/>
   <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> is a gossip protocol but allows and enforces nodes to limit the transaction to the interested parties, to pass only the most interesting job proposals—ones that can result in its own gratification. From an eagle's point of view, this results in a sustainable flow within the network. By prioritizing relevant transactions, the network maintains efficiency and scalability in a game-theorethic way.

7. **The protocol uses cryptography quite intensively. Is it really possible to run <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> on a cheap mobile phone?**<br/>
   Modern mobile phones are incredibly powerful devices with advanced processors, high-resolution displays, and a wide range of features that enable users to do everything from browsing the internet and taking photos to running complex apps and playing games.

Thanks to the rapid advancements in mobile technology and the increasing demand for secure communication, even inexpensive modern mobile phones are now capable of effortlessly computing complex cryptographic algorithms. This accessibility ensures that anyone with a mobile phone can participate in the decentralized gig economy.

8. **Why is the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> here?**<br/>
   <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> works on <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span>, but the <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> (a layer-2 protocol on <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span>) allows micropayments, which are needed for small and frequent settlements between the client and the contractor. This makes network payments smaller compared to transaction fees. The <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> helps but is not critical for the <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> protocol. <span class=gig>Gig-Gossip</span> also runs directly on the <span class=btc>Bitcoin</span> main chain. The <span class=lnd>Lightning Network</span> enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of payments, making it ideal for the dynamic and fast-paced transactions in the gig economy.
