## **Centralized platforms have taken control of the shared economy**. We have become their puppets, and they, our masters. The shared economy is locked down, with innovation allowed only when it benefits the power of these platforms.

## **We are on a mission to reclaim the shared economy for the people**, liberating it from the grasp of centralized platforms. In doing so, we enable the shared economy to blossom with new ideas and unveil its boundless potential.

## **Building a decentralized system tailored to the shared economy** is feasible when constructed on top of <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> and aligned with its principles. Satoshi restored control of money to the people. Similarly, we are demonstrating how the <strong><font color="#f7931a">Lightning Network</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#9900FF">Nostr</font></strong> can help us reclaim the shared economy.

# How does it work?

### BEFORE
There is no communication or direct price negotiation between the customer and the service provider; everything goes through a central system, optimized for its own benefit. Traditional FIAT payment systems are used for monetary transactions.

<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/gen/home/chart1.svg" width="609" height="400">

### AFTER
Communication and price negotiation between the customer and the service provider take place in a free market, naturally regulated by supply and demand. <strong><font color="#f7931a"><strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong></font></strong> and the <strong><font color="#f7931a">Lightning Network</font></strong> are used for secure payments. Screening and dispute resolution are managed by Security Centers—organizations that control final payment settlements.

# Problems with centralized shared economy platforms:
<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/gen/home/night_sky.png" >

1. **Lack of transparency and trust**: Centralized platforms often operate in an opaque manner, where the inner workings, algorithms, and decision-making processes are hidden from gig workers and customers. This lack of transparency breeds mistrust and suspicion about the fairness and integrity of the system.
2. **Misaligned incentives**: Centralized platforms are designed to maximize profits for the company and its shareholders, sometimes at the expense of the workers and customers. This can lead to exploitative practices, such as unfair revenue sharing, arbitrary changes to policies, and prioritizing company interests over the well-being of participants.
3. **Power imbalances and lack of worker autonomy**: Gig workers on centralized platforms often have little say or influence over the policies and decisions that directly impact their livelihoods. They are subject to the whims and unilateral actions of the platform operators, including potential punishments or deactivations without due process.
4. **Limited innovation and competition**: The dominance of a few large centralized platforms can stifle innovation and limit the emergence of new business models and competitors in the gig economy space. This lack of competition can lead to stagnation and suboptimal outcomes for workers and customers.
5. **Privacy and data control concerns**: Centralized platforms accumulate vast amounts of sensitive data about workers and customers, which can be used for surveillance, manipulation, or sold to third parties without adequate consent or control by the individuals involved.

# Gig-gossip design principles

1. **Symmetry**: Each app instance operates the same way as the others, which mirrors the peer-to-peer principle of Bitcoin.
2. **Permissionlessness**: Anyone with an internet connection can join in. No one is gatekept, reflecting the permisionless nature of Bitcoin.
3. **Privacy**: Communication among nodes or clients is encrypted, enhancing user trust by protecting sensitive transactional data.
4. **Anonymity**: The identity of people behind transactions is secret.
5. **Sustainability**: The application’s features should promote honest participation, with built-in mechanisms that inherently disadvantage dishonest actors. This “implicit punishment principle”, taken from Bitcoin, ensures the long-term health of the app ecosystem.
6. **Compliance Consistency**: Staying within legal boundaries is critical, even in decentralized spaces. The app should be developed to comply with laws and regulations over time.

## FAQ

1. **Why did you choose <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> as your monetary basis?**<br/>
   Firstly, <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> implies decentralization, which directly corresponds to the main point of a decentralized gig economy. Secondly, <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> allows us to perform basic financial operations, building trust for money transfers. Thirdly, <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> is permissionless, allowing anyone to join, which increases availability and dissemination of the idea.

2. **Can your idea be used only with the <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> network?**<br/>
   It is not possible to use a classical, fiat money-based monetary system while removing the central organization and making a protocol for a globally decentralized gig economy. Fiat money is centralized by central banks.

3. **What is a mobile mesh?**<br/>
   A mobile mesh is a network of mobile devices connected to each other using wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular data. In a mobile mesh, each device acts as a node in the network, relaying data between each other. Mobile mesh networks are decentralized and self-organizing.

4. **Is Gig-Gossip a protocol for a mobile mesh?**<br/>
   Gig-Gossip can run on mobile devices that form a mobile mesh, but network nodes willing to broadcast messages are welcome to be implemented as heavy machines. Moreover, payment settlers are meant to be services that provide network security; therefore, they are usually implemented by companies as cloud-based services exposing their API. There is no direct need to run any operation-critical services in the cloud or any other centralized computing environment; you just need your mobile phone.

5. **How am I gratified if I only keep running a Gig-Gossip app on my mobile phone?**<br/>
   Your mobile phone running a Gig-Gossip node can earn money each time the route involving your node results in a successful gig payment. You will earn a part of the network reward, which you can negotiate with other nodes on a free market. All you need to do is keep it running.

6. **The protocol is broadcasting a lot of messages. How can the network handle this kind of volume?**<br/>
   Gig-Gossip is a gossip protocol but allows and enforces nodes to limit the transaction to the interested parties. This happens because each broadcast requires the computation of proof of work, so the node is enforced to pass only the most interesting job proposals—ones that can result in its own gratification. From an eagle's point of view, this results in a sustainable flow within the network.

7. **The protocol uses cryptography quite intensively. Is it really possible to run Gig-Gossip on a cheap mobile phone?**<br/>
   Modern mobile phones are incredibly powerful devices with advanced processors, high-resolution displays, and a wide range of features that enable users to do everything from browsing the internet and taking photos to running complex apps and playing games. While cheap mobile phones may have been seen as basic and limited in the past, advancements in technology have made it possible for even budget-friendly devices to be quite powerful and feature-packed today. This is largely due to the continued progression of Moore's Law, which has driven the development of smaller and more efficient processors, allowing even lower-end devices to offer impressive performance and capabilities. Thanks to the rapid advancements in mobile technology and the increasing demand for secure communication, even inexpensive modern mobile phones are now capable of effortlessly computing complex cryptographic algorithms.

8. **Why is the <strong><font color="#f7931a">Lightning Network</font></strong> here?**<br/>
   Gig-Gossip works on <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong>, but the <strong><font color="#f7931a">Lightning Network</font></strong> (a layer-2 protocol on <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong>) allows micropayments, which are needed for small and frequent settlements between the client and the contractor. This makes network payments smaller compared to transaction fees. The <strong><font color="#f7931a">Lightning Network</font></strong> helps but is not critical for the Gig-Gossip protocol. Gig-Gossip also runs directly on the <strong><font color="#f7931a">Bitcoin</font></strong> main chain.
