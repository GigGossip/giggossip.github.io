# How does it work?

<div class="row">
<div class='col-6' style="background-color: white">
<h3>BEFORE</h3>
<p>
There is no communication or direct price negotiation between the customer and the service provider, everything goes through a central system, optimized for its own benefit. Traditional payment systems are used for monetary transactions.
</p>

<div class='col-6' style="background-color: white">
<h3>AFTER</h3>
<p>
Communication and price negotiation between the customer and the service provider takes place on a free market, which is naturally regulated by supply & demand. Bitcoin and Lightning Network are used for secure payments.

## FAQ

1. **Why did you choose Bitcoin as your monetary basis?**<br/>
  Firstly, Bitcoin implies decentralization, which directly corresponds to the main point of decentralized gig-economy. Secondly, Bitcoin allows us to perform basic financial operations and this is the foundation to build the trust for money transfers. Thirdly, Bitcoin is permissionless, anyone can join it, which increases the availability and dissemination of the idea.
2. **Can your idea be used only with the Bitcoin network?**<br/>
  It is not possible to use a classical, fiat money based monetary system, but just removing the central organization and making a protocol for globally decentralized gig economy. Fiat money is centralized by central banks.
3. **What is a mobile mesh?**<br/>
  A mobile mesh is a network of mobile devices that are connected to each other using wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular data. In a mobile mesh, each device acts as a node in the network, relaying data between each other. Mobile mesh networks are decentralized and self-organizing.
4. **Is gig-gossip a protocol for a mobile mesh?**<br/>
  Gig-Gossip can run on mobile devices that form a mobile mesh but network nodes willing to broadcast messages are welcome being implemented as heavy machines. Moreover; payment settlers are meant to be services that provide network security, therefore they are usually implemented by companies in the form of cloud based services exposing their API. Anyway; there is no direct need to run any operation-critical services in the cloud or any other centralized computing environment, you just need your mobile phone.
5.  **How am I gratified if I only keep running a gig-gossip app on my mobile phone?**<br/>
  Your mobile phone running a gig-gossip node is able to earn money each time the route involving your node has resulted in a happy end - gig was paid. You will earn a part of the network reward you can negotiate with other nodes on a free market. All you need to do is to keep it running.
6. **The protocol is broadcasting a lot of messages, how can the network handle this kind of volume?**<br/>
  Gig-Gossip is a gossip protocol but it allows and enforces nodes to limit the traction only to the interested parties. This happens because each and every broadcast requires computation of proof of work so the node is enforced to pass only the most interesting job proposals - ones that can result in its own gratification. From the eagle point of view this results in sustainable flow within the network.
7. **The protocol is using cryptography quite intensively. Is it really possible to run gig-gossip on a cheap mobile phone?**<br/>
  Modern mobile phones are incredibly powerful devices with advanced processors, high-resolution displays, and a wide range of features that enable users to do everything from browsing the internet and taking photos to running complex apps and playing games. While cheap mobile phones may have been seen as basic and limited in the past, advancements in technology have made it possible for even budget-friendly devices to be quite powerful and feature-packed today. This is largely due to the continued progression of Moore's Law, which has driven the development of smaller and more efficient processors, allowing even lower-end devices to offer impressive performance and capabilities. Thanks to the rapid advancements in mobile technology and the increasing demand for secure communication, even inexpensive modern mobile phones are now capable of effortlessly computing complex cryptographic algorithms.
8. **Why is the Lightning Network here?**<br/>
  Gig-Gossip works on Bitcoin but the Lightning network (layer 2 protocol on Bitcoin) allows micropayment which is needed for small and frequent settlements between the client and the contractor so the network payments are small compared to transaction fees. Lightning network helps but it is not critical for Gig-gossip protocol. Gig-gossip runs directly on the Bitcoin main chain too.
